*oh my god, you are serious outputting all the frames of image.*

feature:
* support jpg,png, but finally will save in png file.
* process a lot of animation image and output to one straight image.
* file number by number to handle (before you have to rename your file to 1,2,3,4...etc).
* auto select all folder files.

###Usage
Just download [here](https://github.com/hpcslag/animation2d_splite_helper/releases/download/0.0.1/Animation2d_splite_helper.zip).

###Warring
Recommend you to name file by number, so the file will be stable output.

And you had better to resize image to consistent, because this tool will not help you to center images.
